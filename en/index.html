The only official way to use Tr√§welling at the moment is through the website traewelling.de. All other sites or apps that allow you to interact with Tr√§welling are not official developments from us.
Third-party apps Tr√§welling offers a free API that allows third-party developers to communicate with the service. A list of all (known) projects can be found here.
Authorization Please note that if you use third-party apps, we no longer have any control over your data usage. If you delete your account with us, the data may continue to exist with third-party providers without us being able to change anything. Please think carefully about which apps you want to give access to your data!
Third-party apps are authorized via the OAuth procedure. You confirm the requested access rights in a dialog to be able to use the application. There are still some apps that ask you for your password directly. Gradually, this function will be abolished. The login via authorization request is the variant we recommend.
Remove application access If you want to make sure that third-party applications no longer have access to your data, you can revoke the access in your settings. To do this, click on the red button with the trash can icon under the item &ldquo;API tokens&rdquo; in the line of the application to be removed.
Since you can install apps on multiple devices, they may be listed multiple times in the settings. You may need to delete an app from the list multiple times. Once this app is no longer listed, it will definitely no longer have access to your data.
Please note that applications authenticated via username &amp; password are listed as &ldquo;Tr√§welling Personal Access Client&rdquo;. You won&rsquo;t be able to distinguish any app using this authentication method.

üöÇ Why is my train not listed? We have more detailed information on this on the timetable data page.
If you are missing a connection, you can also add it manually. You can find out how to do this under Features &gt; Add trip manually.
üìä How are points calculated? The points system is somewhat complex - we have therefore created a separate page for it. üéâ What are events? Tr√§welling brings people together who are travelling together on public transport.
Sometimes they are even travelling to the same event - without knowing it! That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve added the event feature.
Via this form an event can be created for a specific time period. Check-ins can then be linked to the event.
‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: Events should offer added value for the entire community.
Good examples are
Railway events (e.g. last trip of the Metropolitan) Hackerspace meetings (e.g. GPN) LGBTQ events (e.g. Cologne Pride) ‚ùå We generally reject smaller, local events such as Christmas markets or city festivals - but exceptions are possible.
You can find out more under Features &gt; Events.
üì≠ Why don&rsquo;t I receive a confirmation email? first check the spam folder. if there is nothing there, please add gertrud@traewelling.de to your contacts. then request the mail again. If you still haven&rsquo;t received an email, please contact us.
üîî Note: Problems often occur with email addresses from Microsoft (e.g. @live.de, @outlook.com, @hotmail.com).
Tip: Try an address from another provider.
üîó What is Tr√§welling? Tr√§welling is a free check-in service.
You can:
tell your friends where you are travelling, document your journeys on public transport and collect points. In short: you check in on trains and get points for it. üöÜ
Every person uses Tr√§welling differently. Some use it as a logbook, others to document their journeys. Or as proof for the tax office for tax reasons.
üßë‚Äçüíª Who develops Tr√§welling? Tr√§welling is an open source project that many people have been working on since 2013, sometimes with small bug fixes, sometimes with large features.
You can find the list of contributors on GitHub.
Some people have also supported us with the alpha version: you can find them here.
üõ†Ô∏è I would also like to help develop Tr√§welling! Nice! Tr√§welling is open source - anyone can join in.
You can find all the information on our GitHub page.
You can:
implement your own ideas, pick tasks from our issues, simply create a pull request. We look forward to every contribution - no matter how small or large!
ü§î Where does the name come from? The name is a reference to the well-known railway phrase:
&ldquo;Senk ju for tr√§welling wis Deutsche Bahn. &ldquo;
Almost everyone knows this from long-distance transport. üòÑ
</p>`,url:"https://help.traewelling.de/en/faq/"},{value:"üìú Community Guidelines",label:`<p>Why Community Guidelines? The Tr√§welling community has become so large that it is necessary to establish some basic rules for the use of Tr√§welling (hereinafter referred to as the platform) in order to ensure peaceful and respectful coexistence.
Enforcement We want to interfere with the community as little as possible. Please make sure that the platform is used properly and that the guidelines are adhered to.
Should measures still be necessary, we will try to make them as non-invasive as possible. This means, for example, that we would rather set the visibility of checkins to private or remove a status text than delete it completely.
Blocking or deleting an account is the last possible measure. We want to avoid this as much as possible.
Guidelines Respectful interaction Respectful interaction with one another is the basis for a functioning community. It is therefore important that everyone treats each other with respect. This means that insults, discrimination, bullying and any form of hate speech will not be tolerated.
Manual journeys Manual journeys, in which other people are visibly checked in, are only intended for public transport.
Not tolerated are e.g. car, bicycle, footpaths. Permitted: Basically everything in the area of public transport/public transport/local public transport/scheduled air transport Exceptions: e.g. on-call cab or cab rides within the scope of passenger rights or deadheading Events You should only check in to events if you are actually taking part in the event. This includes, for example, arrival and departure, preparation and follow-up as well as journeys during the event. This is intended to give other users an easier overview of who is at the event.
API usage If data is obtained from other persons, it must be ensured that this data is not misused. The person processing the data is responsible for compliance with data protection laws.
The use of the API for spam (e.g. automatic liking of status messages) or other abusive purposes is not permitted.
Compliance with laws All activities on the platform must be in compliance with applicable law.

Manual journeys in private cars, bicycles, on foot, etc. are not intended and will be deleted from time to time. More information in the Community guidelines.
It can happen that journeys are not available via the interface used by Tr√§welling and therefore cannot be checked in. It is therefore possible to create a journey manually.
How to create a manual trip At the end of the departure board you will find the ‚ÄòCreate journey‚Äô button. Click on it to create a new manual journey.
Enter the name of the station where you want to get on or off. You will be shown suggestions that you can select. If you cannot find a stop, you can also enter the ID of the stop from Wikidata (see below).
You can add as many stops as you like as intermediate stops. An arrival and departure time is required.
Enter the line you are using.
You can leave the ‚ÄòNumber‚Äô field blank. If your journey has an (internal) journey number, you can enter it here.
In the ‚ÄòCategory‚Äô field, you must select the category of your means of transport.
Add new stations (Wikidata Import) The stop search only displays stops that either exist in our database or are known in our backend used for timetable data. You can therefore also import new stops from Wikidata. Simply search for the station in Wikidata and copy the ID into the search field.
The import feature is not yet ready. Not all types of stations can be imported yet. If nothing happens, the station is not compatible. If you find a bug, please write in the GitHub repo or add the category yourself via a pull request.
</p>`,url:"https://help.traewelling.de/en/features/manual-trips/"},{value:"Points",label:`<p>At Tr√§welling, you receive a certain number of points for every check-in (with exceptions). The points are used exclusively for the gamification of Tr√§welling and have no further use.
Why are my points disappearing? In addition to the total kilometers driven and the time checked in, the points for the last 7 days are also displayed in the user profiles. The points are therefore a rolling total, so that 0 points are displayed after 7 days without a check-in.
When do I get how many points? You will only receive the full points if you check in during your journey or up to 60 minutes before the live departure. If you check in earlier or later, you will be credited the full kilometers and hours, but only one pity point.
In the event of delays, the time period is shifted according to the actual data we receive from the timetable. As these dates are not always correct, we cannot guarantee you full points credit. We therefore recommend that you check in before departure if possible.
How are points calculated? The points are made up of the product class and the distance of your trip.
The distance is rounded to the nearest 10 km and then divided by 10. The base points are then added together. So an ICE journey of 143 km earns you 10 + roundup(143/10) = 10 + 15 = 25 points, for an S-Bahn journey of 8 km you get 2 + roundup(8/10) = 2 + 1 = 3 points.
Long-distance services (ICE, IC, EC, &hellip;): 10 basis points Regional express: 6 basis points Regional: 5 basis points S-Bahn: 3 basis points Bus: 2 basis points Ferry: 3 basis points Subway: 2 basis points Tram: 2 basis points Taxi: 1 basis point You will not receive any points for manually created trips.
