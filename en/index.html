Errors and data loss may occur. The feature will be improved and expanded in the future.
Träwelling mainly uses timetable data from Germany. It may happen that not all connections or trains are available in the database. Especially in countries outside of Germany, there may be gaps. Therefore, there is the possibility to create a trip manually.
To use manual trips, you have to enable Experimental Features in the settings.
Where to find manual trips At the end of the departure board you will find the button &ldquo;Create journey&rdquo;. Click on it to create a new manual trip.
Create manual trip Enter the name of the station where you want to get on or off. Suggestions will be displayed that you can select.
Add the desired stations as intermediate stops.
Enter the times when your vehicle departs or arrives at the stations.
Enter the line you are using.
You can leave the &ldquo;Number&rdquo; field blank. If your trip has a (internal) trip number, you can enter it here.
In the &ldquo;Category&rdquo; field you have to select the category of your means of transport.
Neue Stationen hinzufügen The stop search only shows stops that are either in our database or known in Deutsche Bahn&rsquo;s HAFAS. This is a particular problem for journeys abroad, as many stations are not known there. You can therefore also import new stations from Wikidata. Simply search for the station in Wikidata and copy the ID into the search field.
The import feature is not yet ready. Not all types of stations can be imported yet. If nothing happens, the station is not compatible. If you think that&rsquo;s wrong, please write in the GitHub repo or add the category yourself via a pull request.
Info Please only create trips here whose category is included in the selection field &ldquo;Category&rdquo;. Manual trips in private motor vehicles, bicycles, on foot, etc. are not provided and will be deleted from time to time.

Third-party apps Träwelling offers a free API that allows third-party developers to communicate with the service. A list of all (known) projects can be found here.
Authorization Please note that if you use third-party apps, we no longer have any control over your data usage. If you delete your account with us, the data may continue to exist with third-party providers without us being able to change anything. Please think carefully about which apps you want to give access to your data!
Third-party apps are authorized via the OAuth procedure. You confirm the requested access rights in a dialog to be able to use the application. There are still some apps that ask you for your password directly. Gradually, this function will be abolished. The login via authorization request is the variant we recommend.
Remove application access If you want to make sure that third-party applications no longer have access to your data, you can revoke the access in your settings. To do this, click on the red button with the trash can icon under the item &ldquo;API tokens&rdquo; in the line of the application to be removed.
Since you can install apps on multiple devices, they may be listed multiple times in the settings. You may need to delete an app from the list multiple times. Once this app is no longer listed, it will definitely no longer have access to your data.
Please note that applications authenticated via username &amp; password are listed as &ldquo;Träwelling Personal Access Client&rdquo;. You won&rsquo;t be able to distinguish any app using this authentication method.

🔗 What is Träwelling? Träwelling is a free check-in service that lets you tell your friends where you are and where you can log your public transit journeys. In short, you can check into trains and get points for it. 🧑‍💻 Who develops Träwelling? Träwelling is an open source project. Since 2013, various people have been developing the project. Partly only bugfixes, partly major changes. On GitHub you can view a list of contributors to the code. Additionally, a few people have assisted with the alpha version. You can find them hier. 🛠️ I would like to contribute to Träwelling! Träwelling is an open source project and everyone can contribute. You can find all the information about it on our GitHub page. We are happy about every contribution - simply create a PullRequest! You can either work on your own ideas or pick a task from our Issues on GitHub. 🤔 Where does the name come from? The name is an allusion to the well-known &ldquo;Senk ju for träwelling wis Deutsche Bahn&rdquo;, which you should have heard in almost every long-distance train of the Deutsche Bahn. 🎉 What are events? Träwelling brings people together who use the same public transport. Sometimes those people even ride to the same events, without knowing from another!
That’s why we’ve created the Events feature. Anyone can suggest an event n a specific time frame; and once accepted, all users can connect their check-ins to that event.
If you want to create an event, please make sure that events should benefit the entire Träwelling community. Those events can be from the European railway community such as the last course of a train model, hacking events such as GPN, or from the LGBTQ scene such as Cologne Pride.
Events are something special. That’s why we decided to deny suggestions to smaller, local events such as Christmas Markets or city fairs. As always, there are exceptions to that rule.
You&rsquo;ll find more information at Features &gt; Events
📭 Why don&rsquo;t I receive a confirmation email? First of all, please check if the email is in the spam folder. If the email is not in the spam folder, please add ' gertrud@traewelling.de&rsquo; to your contacts and request the email again. If the email still does not arrive, please contact us via our contact form.
Please note that in the past there were often problems with Microsoft addresses (e.g. Live, Outlook, Hotmail, &hellip;). In this case, please try an e-mail with another provider first.
🚂 Why isn&rsquo;t my train listed? We use an interface of the Deutsche Bahn, where not all offers are displayed directly.
If you&rsquo;re missing a connection, you can create it manually. You can find more information about this in the manual trips section.
📊 How are points calculated? The topic of points is very complex and we have created a separate page for it. </p>`,url:"https://help.traewelling.de/en/faq/"},{value:"📜 Community Guidelines",label:`<p>Why Community Guidelines? The Träwelling community has become so large that it is necessary to establish some basic rules for the use of Träwelling (hereinafter referred to as the platform) in order to ensure peaceful and respectful coexistence.
Enforcement We want to interfere with the community as little as possible. Please make sure that the platform is used properly and that the guidelines are adhered to.
Should measures still be necessary, we will try to make them as non-invasive as possible. This means, for example, that we would rather set the visibility of checkins to private or remove a status text than delete it completely.
Blocking or deleting an account is the last possible measure. We want to avoid this as much as possible.
Guidelines Respectful interaction Respectful interaction with one another is the basis for a functioning community. It is therefore important that everyone treats each other with respect. This means that insults, discrimination, bullying and any form of hate speech will not be tolerated.
Manual journeys Manual journeys, in which other people are visibly checked in, are only intended for public transport.
Not tolerated are e.g. car, bicycle, footpaths. Permitted: Basically everything in the area of public transport/public transport/local public transport/scheduled air transport Exceptions: e.g. on-call cab or cab rides within the scope of passenger rights or deadheading Events You should only check in to events if you are actually taking part in the event. This includes, for example, arrival and departure, preparation and follow-up as well as journeys during the event. This is intended to give other users an easier overview of who is at the event.
API usage If data is obtained from other persons, it must be ensured that this data is not misused. The person processing the data is responsible for compliance with data protection laws.
The use of the API for spam (e.g. automatic liking of status messages) or other abusive purposes is not permitted.
Compliance with laws All activities on the platform must be in compliance with applicable law.

</p>`,url:"https://help.traewelling.de/en/guidelines/"},{value:"Alerts",label:"<p></p>",url:"https://help.traewelling.de/en/alerts/"},{value:"Points",label:`<p>At Träwelling, you receive a certain number of points for every check-in (with exceptions). The points are used exclusively for the gamification of Träwelling and have no further use.
Why are my points disappearing? In addition to the total kilometers driven and the time checked in, the points for the last 7 days are also displayed in the user profiles. The points are therefore a rolling total, so that 0 points are displayed after 7 days without a check-in.
When do I get how many points? You will only receive the full points if you check in during your journey or up to 60 minutes before the live departure. If you check in earlier or later, you will be credited the full kilometers and hours, but only one pity point.
In the event of delays, the time period is shifted according to the actual data we receive from the timetable. As these dates are not always correct, we cannot guarantee you full points credit. We therefore recommend that you check in before departure if possible.
How are points calculated? The points are made up of the product class and the distance of your trip.
The distance is rounded to the nearest 10 km and then divided by 10. The base points are then added together. So an ICE journey of 143 km earns you 10 + roundup(143/10) = 10 + 15 = 25 points, for an S-Bahn journey of 8 km you get 2 + roundup(8/10) = 2 + 1 = 3 points.
Long-distance services (ICE, IC, EC, &hellip;): 10 basis points Regional express: 6 basis points Regional: 5 basis points S-Bahn: 3 basis points Bus: 2 basis points Ferry: 3 basis points Subway: 2 basis points Tram: 2 basis points Taxi: 1 basis point You will not receive any points for manually created trips.
