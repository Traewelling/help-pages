The only official way to use Tr√§welling at the moment is through the website https://traewelling.de. All other sites or apps that allow you to interact with Tr√§welling are not official developments from us.
Drittanbieter-Apps Tr√§welling offers a free API that allows third-party developers to communicate with the service. A list of all (known) projects can be found here.
Autorisierung Please note that if you use third-party apps, we no longer have any control over your data usage. If you delete your account with us, the data may continue to exist with third-party providers without us being able to change anything. Please think carefully about which apps you want to give access to your data!
Third-party apps are authorized via the OAuth procedure. You confirm the requested access rights in a dialog to be able to use the application. There are still some apps that ask you for your password directly. Gradually, this function will be abolished. The login via authorization request is the variant we recommend.
Remove application access If you want to make sure that third-party applications no longer have access to your data, you can revoke the access in your settings. To do this, click on the red button with the trash can icon under the item \u0026ldquo;API tokens\u0026rdquo; in the line of the application to be removed.
Since you can install apps on multiple devices, they may be listed multiple times in the settings. You may need to delete an app from the list multiple times. Once this app is no longer listed, it will definitely no longer have access to your data.
Please note that applications authenticated via username \u0026amp; password are listed as \u0026ldquo;Tr√§welling Personal Access Client\u0026rdquo;. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to distinguish any app using this authentication method.

Our project lives from being open source, and we live the open source idea. Therefore, we ask you to link only open source projects here.

In short, you can check into trains and get points for it. Wer entwickelt Tr√§welling? Tr√§welling is an open source project. Since 2013, various people have been developing the project. Partly only bugfixes, partly major changes. On GitHub you can view a list of contributors to the code. Additionally, a few people have assisted with the alpha version. You can find them hier. I would like to contribute to Tr√§welling! Tr√§welling is an open source project and everyone can contribute. You can find all the information about it on our GitHub page. We are happy about every contribution - simply create a PullRequest! You can either work on your own ideas or pick a task from our Issues on GitHub. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us on our discord server: https://discord.gg/QypAnG2qAw Where does the name come from? The name is an allusion to the well-known \u0026ldquo;Senk ju for tr√§welling wis Deutsche Bahn\u0026rdquo;, which you should have heard in almost every long-distance train of the Deutsche Bahn. What are events? Tr√§welling brings people together who use the same public transport. Sometimes those people even ride to the same events, without knowing from another!
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created the Events feature. Anyone can suggest an event n a specific time frame; and once accepted, all users can connect their check-ins to that event.
If you want to create an event, please make sure that events should benefit the entire Tr√§welling community. Those events can be from the European railway community such as the last course of a train model, hacking events such as GPN, or from the LGBTQ scene such as Cologne Pride.
Events are something special. That‚Äôs why we decided to deny suggestions to smaller, local events such as Christmas Markets or city fairs. As always, there are exceptions to that rule.
Why don\u0026rsquo;t I receive a confirmation email? First of all, please check if the email is in the spam folder. If the email is not in the spam folder, please add \u0026lsquo;gertrud@traewelling.de\u0026rsquo; to your contacts and request the email again. If the email still does not arrive, please contact us via our contact form.
Please note that in the past there were often problems with Microsoft addresses (e.g. Live, Outlook, Hotmail, \u0026hellip;). In this case, please try an e-mail with another provider first.
Why isn\u0026rsquo;t my train listed? We use an interface of the Deutsche Bahn, where not all offers are displayed directly. Unfortunately, we can\u0026rsquo;t do much with it if your train is not there. How are points calculated? The points consist of the product class and the distance of your journey.
product category Base points Express (ICE, \u0026hellip;) 10 Express (IC, EC, \u0026hellip;) 10 Regional Express 6 Local 5 Suburban 3 Bus 2 Ferry 3 Subway 2 Tram 2 Taxi 1 The distance is rounded to the nearest 10km and then divided by 10. Afterwards the base points are added. An ICE journey of 143 km thus earns you 10 \u002b round up(143/10) = 10 \u002b 15 = 25 points, for an S-Bahn journey of 8 km you get 2 \u002b round up(8/10) = 2 \u002b 1 = 3 points. We want you to check in as soon as possible so that the platform always has an up-to-date status of your journeys. Therefore, you will only receive full points if you check in during your journey or 20min before live departure (scheduled departure \u002b delay). If you check in 1h before or after the travel period, you can still get 1/4 of the points. If you check in earlier or later on a connection, you will receive the full kilometres and hours, but only one pity point.
If your connection is delayed you should make sure to check in before the real departure time, as we cannot get real-time information about the trip after the real departure time.
