The only official way to use Tr√§welling at the moment is through the website &lt;a href="https://traewelling.de"&gt;traewelling.de&lt;/a&gt;.
All other sites or apps that allow you to interact with Tr√§welling are not official developments from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="third-party-apps"&gt;Third-party apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tr√§welling offers a free &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; that allows third-party developers to communicate with
the service.
A list of all (known) projects can be found &lt;a href="https://help.traewelling.de/en/community/list-of-third-party-apps/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
