On traewelling.de/events you can find a list of events that are listed with us. If there is an event missing that you would like to check in to, you can also submit a suggestion on the page.
Criteria for events Since we can&amp;rsquo;t and don&amp;rsquo;t want to accept every festival, demonstration, fair or whatever, events should meet a few criteria in order for us to list them on Tr√§welling.</description></item><item><title>üë• Team</title><link>https://help.traewelling.de/en/governance/team/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://help.traewelling.de/en/governance/team/</guid><description> HerrLevin_ MrKrisKrisu confuzd_ Initiator, Development, Support Development, Support Development, Support Mastodon Mastodon Mastodon</description></item><item><title>üí∞ Finance</title><link>https://help.traewelling.de/en/governance/finance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://help.traewelling.de/en/governance/finance/</guid><description>The Tr√§welling team pays all expenses from private pockets.
