# Tr√§welling Help Pages

This repository uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a modified [unicef inventory theme](https://github.com/unicef/inventory-hugo-theme).

To contribute you can simply edit the markdown files.

If you want to preview your changes locally you need to install hugo.
You'll also need to fetch the theme's submodule: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

After that you can just `hugo serve` and you'll see your preview locally.
