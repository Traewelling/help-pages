### Why Community Guidelines?

The TrÃ¤welling community has become so large that it is necessary to establish some basic rules for the use of TrÃ¤welling 
(hereinafter referred to as the platform) in order to ensure peaceful and respectful coexistence.

### Enforcement

[We](/governance/team) want to interfere with the community as little as possible.
Please make sure that the platform is used properly and that the guidelines are adhered to.

Should measures still be necessary, we will try to make them as non-invasive as possible.
This means, for example, that we would rather set the visibility of checkins to private or remove a status text than delete it completely.

Blocking or deleting an account is the last possible measure. We want to avoid this as much as possible.

### Guidelines

#### Respectful interaction

Respectful interaction with one another is the basis for a functioning community.
It is therefore important that everyone treats each other with respect.
This means that insults, discrimination, bullying and any form of hate speech will not be tolerated.

#### Manual journeys

Manual journeys, **in which other people are visibly checked in**, are only intended for public transport.

- Not tolerated are e.g. car, bicycle, footpaths.
- Permitted: Basically everything in the area of public transport/public transport/local public transport/scheduled air transport
- Exceptions: e.g. on-call cab or cab rides within the scope of passenger rights or deadheading

#### Events

You should only check in to events if you are actually taking part in the event.
This includes, for example, arrival and departure, preparation and follow-up as well as journeys during the event.
This is intended to give other users an easier overview of who is at the event.

#### API usage

If data is obtained from other persons, it must be ensured that this data is not misused.
The person processing the data is responsible for compliance with data protection laws.

The use of the API for spam (e.g. automatic liking of status messages) or other abusive purposes is not permitted.

#### Compliance with laws

<!-- Applicable laws where? Germany as a whole? International users? -->
All activities on the platform must be in compliance with applicable law.
