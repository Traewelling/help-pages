title: "Points"

At Träwelling, you receive a certain number of points for every check-in (with exceptions).
The points are used exclusively for the [gamification](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) of Träwelling and
have no further use.

#### Why are my points disappearing?

In addition to the total kilometers driven and the time checked in, the points for the last 7 days are also displayed in
the user profiles.
The points are therefore a rolling total, so that 0 points are displayed after 7 days without a check-in.

#### When do I get how many points?

You will only receive the full points if you check in during your journey or up to 60 minutes before the live departure.
If you check in earlier or later, you will be credited the full kilometers and hours, but only one pity point.

{{<notice warning>}}
In the event of delays, the time period is shifted according to the actual data we receive from the timetable.
As these dates are not always correct, we cannot guarantee you full points credit.
We therefore recommend that you check in before departure if possible.

#### How are points calculated?

The points are made up of the product class and the distance of your trip.

The distance is rounded to the nearest 10 km and then divided by 10.
The base points are then added together.
So a journey with a national express train of 143 km earns you `10 + roundup(143/10) = 10 + 15 = 25` points, 
for a suburban journey of 8 km you get `3 + roundup(8/10) = 3 + 1 = 4` points.

Technically, the following categories are distinguished:

- **Nationalexpress**: 10 basis points
- **National**: 8 basis points
- **Regionalexpress**: 8 basis points
- **Regional**: 6 basis points
- **Suburban**: 3 basis points
- **Ferry**: 3 basis points
- **Subway**: 2 basis points
- **Bus**: 2 basis points
- **Tram**: 2 basis points
- **Taxi**: 1 basis point
