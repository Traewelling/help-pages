When you check in to public transport journeys, you can also check in to events if, for example, you are on your way to or from them.
On [traewelling.de/events](https://traewelling.de/events) you can find a list of events that are listed with us.
If there is an event missing that you would like to check in to, you can also submit a suggestion on the page.

### Criteria for events

Since we can't and don't want to accept every festival, demonstration, fair or whatever, events should meet a few criteria in order for us to list them on Träwelling.
These are not 100% binding.
The [Träwelling Team](/governance/team) reserves the right to use their own discretion to decide whether to accept or reject events.
However, there are a few pro and con criteria that influence the decision.

#### Pro-Criteria

+ Relation to rail, buses or other public transportation.
+ Short event
+ Event promoting tolerance, diversity, climate protection and the environment

#### Contra criteria

- local festival
- Event length > 3 days
- Right-wing ideas
- concerts
