{{< notice important >}}
Manual trips are currently in an early beta stage. Errors and data loss may occur.
The feature will be improved and expanded in the future.
{{</ notice >}}

Tr√§welling mainly uses timetable data from Germany. It may happen that not all connections or trains are available in the database.
Especially in countries outside of Germany, there may be gaps.
Therefore, there is the possibility to create a trip manually.

{{< notice info >}}
To use manual trips, you have to enable Experimental Features in the settings.
