The [Träwelling Team](/governance/team) pays all expenses out of private pocket.
We do not accept donations and have no income.

TL;DR: We pay about 20,37 € per month to run Träwelling.

Träwelling itself runs on a server hosted by Netcup in Nuremberg, Germany.

### Server

- 10 vCores
- 12 GB RAM
- Location: Nuremberg, Germany
- 480 GB SSD (RAID10)

Costs: 13,59 € per month

### Backups

We store our backups in another data center at Hetzner.

Costs: 3,81 € per month

### Monitoring

Our Grafana dashboard runs on a private server that is “already” used for Grafana.

Costs: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
