[‚ûï Request feature](https://github.com/Traewelling/traewelling/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=)

{{< faq "üîó What is Tr√§welling?" >}}
Tr√§welling is a free check-in service that lets you tell your friends where you are and where you can log your public
transit journeys.
In short, you can check into trains and get points for it.
{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "üßë‚Äçüíª Who develops Tr√§welling?" >}}
Tr√§welling is an open source project.
Since 2013, various people have been developing the project.
Partly only bugfixes, partly major changes.
On [GitHub](https://github.com/Traewelling/traewelling/graphs/contributors) you can view a list of contributors to the
code.
Additionally, a few people have assisted with the alpha version.
You can find them [hier](https://traewelling.de/humans.txt).

{{< faq "üõ†Ô∏è I would like to contribute to Tr√§welling! " >}}
Tr√§welling is an open source project and everyone can contribute. You can find all the information about it on our
GitHub page. We are happy about every contribution - simply create a PullRequest! You can either work on your own ideas
or pick a task from our Issues on GitHub.

{{< faq "ü§î Where does the name come from?" >}}
The name is an allusion to the well-known "*Senk ju for tr√§welling wis Deutsche Bahn*", which you should have heard in
almost every long-distance train of the Deutsche Bahn.

{{< faq "üéâ What are events? " >}}
Tr√§welling brings people together who use the same public transport. Sometimes those people even ride to the same
events, without knowing from another!

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created the Events feature. Anyone [can suggest an event](https://traewelling.de/events/suggest) n a
specific time frame; and once accepted, all users can connect their check-ins to that event.

If you want to create an event, please make sure that events should benefit the entire Tr√§welling community.
Those events can be from the European railway community such
as [the last course of a train model](https://traewelling.de/statuses/event/letzte_fahrt_des_met), hacking events such
as [GPN](https://traewelling.de/statuses/event/gpn20), or from the LGBTQ scene such
as [Cologne Pride](https://traewelling.de/statuses/event/csd_koln_2022).

Events are something special. That‚Äôs why we decided to deny suggestions to smaller, local events such as Christmas
Markets or city fairs. As always, there are exceptions to that rule.

You'll find more information at [Features > Events](/features/events)

{{< faq "üì≠ Why don't I receive a confirmation email? " >}}
First of all, please check if the email is in the spam folder. If the email is not in the spam folder, please add '
gertrud@traewelling.de' to your contacts and request the email again. If the email still does not arrive, please contact
us via our contact form.

{{<notice info>}}
Please note that in the past there were often problems with Microsoft addresses (e.g. Live, Outlook, Hotmail, ...). In
this case, please try an e-mail with another provider first.

{{< faq "üöÇ Why isn't my train listed?" >}}
We use an interface of the Deutsche Bahn, where not all offers are displayed directly.

If you're missing a connection, you can create it manually.
You can find more information about this in the [manual trips section](/features/manual-trips).

{{< faq "üìä How are points calculated?" >}}
The topic of points is very complex and we have created a [separate page](/en/features/points) for it.
