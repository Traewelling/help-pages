[‚ûï Request feature](https://github.com/Traewelling/traewelling/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=)


{{< faq "üöÇ Why is my train not listed? " >}}
We have more detailed information on this on the [timetable data page](/features/timetable).

If you are missing a connection, you can also add it manually.
You can find out how to do this under [Features > Add trip manually](/features/manual-trips).
{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "üìä How are points calculated?" >}}
The points system is somewhat complex - we have therefore created a [separate page](/features/points) for it.
{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "üéâ What are events?" >}}
Tr√§welling brings people together who are travelling together on public transport.

Sometimes they are even travelling to the same event - without knowing it!
That's why we've added the event feature.

Via [this form](https://traewelling.de/events) an event can be created for a specific time period.
Check-ins can then be linked to the event.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: Events should offer added value for the entire community.

Good examples are
- Railway events (e.g. last trip of the Metropolitan)
- Hackerspace meetings (e.g. GPN)
- LGBTQ events (e.g. Cologne Pride)

‚ùå We generally reject smaller, local events such as Christmas markets or city festivals - but exceptions are possible.

You can find out more under [Features > Events](/features/events).

{{< faq "üîó What is Tr√§welling? " >}}

Tr√§welling is a free check-in service.

You can:
- tell your friends where you are travelling,
- document your journeys on public transport and
- collect points.

In short: you check in on trains and get points for it. üöÜ

Every person uses Tr√§welling differently.
Some use it as a logbook, others to document their journeys.
Or as proof for the tax office for tax reasons.

{{< faq "ü§î Where does the name come from?" >}}

The name is a reference to the well-known railway phrase:  
**"Senk ju for tr√§welling wis Deutsche Bahn. "**

Almost everyone knows this from long-distance transport. üòÑ
